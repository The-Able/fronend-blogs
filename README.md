# Getting Started

This project was MUIed (React Component Library) , which shows blogs and makes you create a blog and comments.	In a create blog page, if your posted blog’ s title exists already, you will show the warning alert. 

## Client-side usage(PORT: 3000)
```terminal
$ cd client   // go to client folder
$ npm i       // npm install packages
$ npm run dev // run it locally
// deployment for client app
$ npm run build // this will compile the react code using webpack and generate a folder called docs in the root level
$ npm run start // this will run the files in docs, this behavior is exactly the same how gh-pages will run your static site
```
